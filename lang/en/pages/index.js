      'The use of insects opens up completely new perspectives for efficient and sustainable food production. In particular, the production of innovative feed for species-appropriate and environmentally compatible livestock farming with the help of insects holds immense potential. In the wild, fish, chickens and pigs feed to a considerable extent on flies, beetles and worms. So why should we deprive our livestock and pets of their natural food source?',

      'Conventional feed production is currently mostly limited to cost estimates and operates purely for profit. This type of production is neither sustainable, nor does it make full use of resources. The resulting costs and pollution of our planet can be avoided with the help of innovative and modern feed production. Another reason for switching to modern feeds is the high impact on the environment. In the fight against climate change, we must work together to find ways to promote savings and optimization in one of the most important areas, food production.',

      'We use the larva of the black soldier fly (lat. Hermetia Illucens, BSF) for the targeted "upcycling" of proteins into a high-quality feed. Our fly larvae are fed exclusively with by-products from the food industry that are approved as animal feed. This allows us to guarantee a stable process and exclude the introduction of harmful substances. Furthermore, we do not need an additional heat source for the production of our fly larvae. The use of land for breeding the black soldier fly is extremely efficient. Up to one ton of insect protein can be produced per year on one m².',
